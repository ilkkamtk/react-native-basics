# React Native 101

This is course material for learning how to make a mobile app for Android and iOS using only JavaScript.


The sample app in the `/example` directory is based on Facebook's [`create-react-native-app`](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). It's meant to work as a boilerplate for developing your own app. It has ready examples of all the sections featured in the course.

### Goals
During the course you will learn how to:

* Develop a mobile app for both Andorid and iOS in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
* Build a robust navigation with [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation.html)
* Connect to APIs with [fetch](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html)
* Handle app state with [Redux]()
* Write modern functional ES2015/ES6 version JavaScript
* Maintain a good project structure for a scalable app

Learning how to write tests and release apps to AppStore and Play Store are out of the scope of this course.

### Structure
The course is divided into sections We'll go through each section of the course together in class, including plenty of time to write your own code.

1. Setting up
2. [React Native Components](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/components-and-apis.html)

### Prerequisites
You will need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). See their respective links for installation instructions.

If using a physical iOS or Android device to test, also install [Expo](https://expo.io/) from AppStore or Play Store on that device.

Downloading tools like Android Studio or Xcode isn't necessary. However, if you have them installed, you can use the typically included Android emulator and iOS Simulator to run your app.
